== Purpose
The agent integration tests contain test cases for testing the
https://github.com/stackabletech/agent[Agent] against a running Stackable
cluster. The cluster with the agent must already be started before
executing the integration tests and it must be reachable over the local
Kubernetes configuration.

== Build
The Rust toolchain including Cargo must be installed. If you need to
install this, generally the recommended way is to use
https://rustup.rs/[rustup].

The integration tests can be built and run with the following command:

    cargo test

== Contributing
The agent and the integration tests are developed as open source tools
and we absolutely welcome any contributions! Don't hesitate to drop us a
line at info@stackable.de or reach out directly to any of our
committers/contributors.
